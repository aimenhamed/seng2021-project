Introduction:
The problem we are trying to solve is to provide a centralised web application for making cocktails that is user friendly and useful for cocktail makers of all experiences.

This web application used ReactJS for the frontend UI and Python Flask for the backend server, handling the API from TheCocktailDB (https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php).

Ports:
Frontend - 3000
Backend - 5050

# Usage
To run:
1. In *SourceCode_and_Documentation/backend*, run the command *'pip3 install -r requirements.txt'* (python3 modules for the backend server in backend/).
2. In *SourceCode_and_Documentation/frontend*, run the command *'npm install'* (frontend React frontend/src).
3. To start the backend server, ensure that port 5050 is open. Then run the command *'python3 SourceCode_and_Documentation/backend/src/server.py'* (from backend/src/).
4. To start the frontend server, ensure that port 3000 is open. Then run the command npm start in the *SourceCode_and_Documentation/frontend* server (from frontend/src/).
